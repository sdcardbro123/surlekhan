# SurLekhan
**Audio-Based File Transfer System Using Python**

## Overview
SurLekhan is a Python-based project developed as a school computer science assignment in early 2025. The project demonstrates how digital data can be transmitted using sound waves instead of conventional networking methods.

The core idea behind SurLekhan is to convert textual data into binary form, encode the binary data into audio signals, and then reconstruct the original data by decoding the received sound. The project is inspired by concepts similar to GGWave and focuses on understanding data encoding and transmission using audio.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to:
- Convert text data into binary format  
- Encode binary data into sound waves  
- Transmit data using audio signals  
- Decode the received audio back into binary  
- Reconstruct the original text file  

## Working Principle
1. A text file is taken as input by the program  
2. Each character in the file is converted into its binary ASCII representation  
3. Binary data is mapped to predefined audio frequencies  
4. Sound waves are generated and played through the speaker  
5. The receiving program captures the audio input  
6. The audio signal is decoded back into binary data  
7. The original text file is reconstructed from the binary data  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- NumPy  
- SoundDevice  
- Wave module  
- OS module  
- Sys module  

## Features
- Audio-based data transmission  
- Does not require internet connectivity  
- Simple and lightweight implementation  
- Useful for understanding data encoding concepts  

## Sample Output
- Input text successfully converted to binary  
- Audio signal generated and transmitted  
- Binary data decoded correctly  
- Original text file reconstructed  

## Advantages
- Works without network or internet access  
- Demonstrates alternative data transmission techniques  
- Educational and easy to understand  

## Limitations
- Sensitive to noise and external interference  
- Slow data transfer speed  
- Limited to small-sized text files  

## Future Scope
- Implementation of error detection and correction  
- Faster and more efficient encoding methods  
- Support for larger files and additional file formats  
- Graphical user interface for ease of use  

## Conclusion
SurLekhan successfully demonstrates the concept of file transfer using sound waves. The project provides a practical understanding of how digital data can be encoded, transmitted, and decoded using audio signals.
